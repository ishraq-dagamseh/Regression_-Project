# Regression_-Project
In this repo. we applied several types of Regression Machine learning models: Polynomial Regression, SVR and logistic regression models on structured data:(choclate.csv), which consist from two feaures: name and quality of choclate and one label: price, so we will applied the previous ML models on the dataset to predict the price of choclate based on the name and the quality of the choclate.
In this project we Modified the loss function 2.L2 which prevent weight from going to high values and next img display summary about the main Regularization Techniques in ML, like:
